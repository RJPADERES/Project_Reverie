# Project_Reverie
Project For An All In One Application for Windows and Android

Project Reverie employs a dynamic blend of Python coding on the server side and Java language on the client side to establish a seamless connection between a computer and an Android device. Leveraging TCP communication, the application facilitates command transmission, with Python executing commands on the server device while Java adeptly conveys these commands from the client device's command-line interface. This harmonious integration of Python and Java empowers users to interact fluidly and efficiently across platforms, enhancing the overall user experience.
